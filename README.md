# Decentralized Education System

## Project Overview
This project is a decentralized education system that utilizes the power of blockchain technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and web development tools like React and Python. This system aims to democratize education, making it accessible and verifiable for everyone, everywhere.

## Technologies Used
1. Solidity: The smart contracts driving the decentralized application (dApp) are written in Solidity, the statically-typed programming language for Ethereum blockchain.

2. Python: Python is used for backend development, data processing and interacting with the AI models.

3. React: This JavaScript library is used for building the user interface of the dApp.

## Features

1. Decentralized Certificates: The application issues certificates on the blockchain, making them immutable and easily verifiable.
2. Personalized Learning Paths: AI technology is used to create personalized learning paths for students.
3. Peer-to-Peer Learning: The system allows for peer-to-peer learning and mentoring, promoting collaborative education.
4. Transparent Grading System: The grading system is transparent and tamper-proof, with grades being stored on the blockchain.
5. AI Tutors: AI tutors provide learning support, including answering queries and offering resources.
